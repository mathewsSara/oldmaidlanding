        <h3>How to Play Old Maid</h3>
        <h4>How many players?</h4>
        <p>2 or More. You may play with others online or add bot players.</p>
        <h4>What do I need to play?</h4>
        <p>A standard 52 card deck, with 3 of the Queens removed. There should be 49 cards total.</p>
        <h4>What are the controls?</h4>
        <p>lorem ipsum</p>
        <h4>Rules</h4>
        <p>Win Condition: The player(s) without any cards left will win.</p>
        <p>One Queen is removed before the deck of cards will be divided among the players. The cards do not need to be evenly distributed. All cards but the removed Queen must be in play.</p>
        <p>Every player will remove matching pairs from their hand and put them in the discard pile face down.</p>
        <p>Once all players have finished finding the pairs in their hand, the dealer will allow the player to their left to pick a random card from their hand. Once the player has selected a card, the player will see if it has a match. Matching cards will be put in the discard pile. The player will then allow the player to their left to pick a card. This cycle repeats until the unpaired Queen is found! </p>
