        <h3>How to Play Old Maid</h3>
        <hr>
        <h4>How many players?</h4>
        <p>2 or More. You may play with others online or add bot players.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>What do I need to play?</h4>
        <p>A standard 52 card deck, with 3 of the Queens removed. There should be 49 cards total.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>What are the controls?</h4>
        <p>Click on the cards.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Rules</h4>
        <p>Win Condition: The player(s) without any cards left will win.</p>
        <p>Three Queens are removed before the deck of cards is divided among the players. The cards do not need to be evenly distributed. 49 cards will be in play.</p>
        <p>Every player will remove matching pairs from their hand and discard them. This will be done automatically for you in this game.</p>
        <p>Once all players have finished finding the pairs in their hand, the dealer will allow the player to their left to pick a random card from their hand. Once the player has selected a card, the player will see if it has a match. Matching cards will be discarded automatically for you. The player will then allow the player to their left to pick a card. This cycle repeats until the unpaired Queen is the last card standing! </p>
